"And while you are still talking there with the king, see, I will come in after you and say that your story is true.","0,0,1"
"Then Bath-sheba went into the kings room; now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was waiting on him.","0,0,1"

"Then the king said, May the God of Israel be praised, who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it.","0,0,1"
"And all the guests of Adonijah got up in fear and went away, every man to his place.","0,0,1"
"And Adonijah himself was full of fear because of Solomon; and he got up and went to the altar, and put his hands on its horns.","0,0,1"

"For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure","0,1,0"
"For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water.","0,1,0"
"And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire.","0,1,0"
"And they gave Solomon word of it, saying, See, Adonijah goes in such fear of King Solomon, that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.","0,0,1"
"And Solomon said, If he is seen to be a man of good faith, not a hair of him will be touched; but if any wrongdoing is seen in him, he is to be put to death.","0,0,1"
"So King Solomon sent, and they took him down from the altar. And he came and gave honour to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.","0,0,1"
